# Clipy

iPhone video clip editor with social publishing. Built with Expo (React Native + TypeScript)
and a Swift/AVFoundation native module. Developed on Windows; iOS builds run on EAS Build.

Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-clip-editor-app-design.md`

## Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS and npm
- The free **Expo Go** app on your iPhone (App Store)

## Daily development (Expo Go, free)

```powershell
npm install
npx expo start --go
```

Scan the QR code with the iPhone Camera app; add `--tunnel` if the phone can't reach the PC.
In Expo Go the Swift video engine is not available: the app shows a "native module is not
linked" message where native features would run. All TypeScript features work.

Expo Go only runs the current Expo SDK; if a new SDK ships, upgrade the project
(`npx expo install expo@latest` then `npx expo install --fix`) before Expo Go will open it again.

## Running the real native engine (needs an Apple Developer account, $99/year)

One-time: `npm install -g eas-cli`, `eas login`, `eas init`, `eas device:create`.
Then build in the cloud and install from the link EAS prints:

```powershell
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

Afterwards use `npx expo start --dev-client` instead of `--go`. Rebuild whenever anything
under `modules/clipy-video/ios/`, `app.json` plugins, or native dependencies change.

## Checks

```powershell
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

## Layout

- `app/` — screens (Expo Router)
- `modules/clipy-video/` — Swift native module (`ios/`) and its TypeScript wrapper (`index.ts`)
- `docs/superpowers/` — specs and implementation plans
